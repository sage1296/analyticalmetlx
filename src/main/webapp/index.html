			<p>MeTL is a windows client for the MeTL system.  It requires Dot.Net 4.6 or later to run, and permits full collaboration between all participants in a MeTL conversation.  It enables conversation participants to ink, insert and manipulate images and text, follow the conversation owner throughout the conversation, respond to polls and submit unsolicited rich media to the conversation owner.  It enables users to create new conversations, insert, duplicate and reorder slides, and to import Microsoft Powerpoint files to use as the basis of new MeTL conversations.  It allows the owner of a conversation to manage the participants of that conversation, and their content.</p>

		<h2><a href="/metlviewer">MeTL Viewer</a></h2>
		<p>MeTL Viewer is a http1.0 compliant non-collaborative web-client for the MeTL system.  It will ensure that students are up to date with the content on the slide.
