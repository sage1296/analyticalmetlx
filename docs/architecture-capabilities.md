## Capabilities

The MeTL system fulfills several capabilities within an institution.  It is designed to bridge maturity gaps often found in small colleges and schools so that IT budget can be focussed on core activities, providing non-enterprise class implementations of commonly required systems.  Large institutions may prefer to have MeTL forward artifacts to their centralised systems for consistent addressing and storage.
