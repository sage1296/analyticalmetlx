To find a conversation, enter a query into the search box and click `Search` or press `Enter`. 
Search results are displayed in the table below. 

Initially the search box will be populated with the current username, 
resulting in a list of the conversations created by the current user.

## Start a Conversation

There are two ways to start a new conversation. 
Recently created conversations are tagged as **new** in the Lifecycle column.

### Create a Blank Conversation

This button creates an empty, unrestricted conversation with a single blank page. 
This is a good starting point for a free-form teaching session.   

### Create a Conversation by Importing a File

This button prompts for the user to choose a file to import, from which a new conversation will be created. 
This is useful when teaching materials have been created prior to the teaching session.
