<h1>Welcome to MeTL</h1>

<img src="images/ironman-full.png" alt="MeTL Collaboration" width="350px" class="text-image"/>

MeTL supports learning in a collaborative space for teachers and students. It is equally functional across synchronous and asynchronous spaces, and partners well with structured activity repositories such as LMSs and document stores. 

MeTL is fundamentally a shared visual space for anonymous freehand collaboration, as well as a fully featured multi-user video system supporting face-to-face collaboration and chat. It scales to hundreds of users in the same visual space, as well as more than 20 video streams per session interacting simultaneously.

All data in any medium shared across MeTL is automatically archived and is the foundation of a machine intelligence which actively intervenes during and after class. This guides teachers to devote their precious time and attention most effectively and gives unprecedented insight into the activity and understanding of a group.
