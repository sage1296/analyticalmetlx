## How do I make MeTL full screen?

In most browsers, press the F11 key (on some laptops you may have to hold the Function key while pressing F11).
 
*Note: Microsoft has not implemented this feature in the Edge browser.*

## Which browser should I use?

Development and testing are primarily performed on Chrome, Edge and Safari. Firefox and IE are generally less 
compatible with MeTL, so some features may not work as intended. Opera is untested.

## Which device should I use?

MeTL is designed with a responsive layout that works on both PCs and tablets. We test on large monitors, 
iPads and iPad minis.
 
## Why doesn't feature X work?
 
This table contains some known issues with the commonly used browsers that MeTL is tested with.
It is not an exhaustive list of features or browsers. 

Feature | Chrome (Win10) | Edge (Win10) | Safari (OSX) | Safari (iOS) | Firefox (Win10) | IE 11 (Win10)

# Conversation

## How do I return to [Conversation Search](guide-conversation-search.html)?
1. Click **Options**.
2. Click **Conversations**.

## How do I select a single item?
When you click on the [canvas](guide.html#conversation-interface), all content that you own and that intersects the point you clicked will be selected. 
To deselect unwanted content, click on the unwanted content in an area where only that content occurs. 
You may have to do this several times to isolate a single piece of content from other content 
that has been selected because they overlapped the area that was selected. 

This is a subtractive method of content selection and is designed for mobile devices. 
It is the opposite of the additive method generally used in applications with a keyboard, such as PowerPoint.

## How do I undo an action?

An Undo button is not included because of the potential interactions between content belonging to different participants. 
If you want to undo a deletion, there is a feature that recovers deleted content. 

1. Click **Options**.
2. Click **Recycle Bin**.
3. Navigate to the deleted item and click **Restore Content**.

## How do I edit a text box?
1. Click **Text**.
2. Click the text you want to edit.

This will display a selection marquee around the text, and place you into edit mode.

## How do I zoom to a particular part of the Canvas?
1. Click on **Zoom**.
2. Drag a marquee around the area you want to zoom into.

Note: the aspect ratio of the device screen will control the aspect ratio of the zoom marquee.

## How do I create a custom background on a page? 
1. Create a background (e.g. graph paper) in PowerPoint or a drawing application and save it as an image. 
2. Click on *Insert Image*.
3. Browse for your saved image.
4. Position and stretch it as desired. 

Using this principle, a library of desired images can easily be generated and reused.

## How do I send students a link to a particular page?
1. Click on **Options**.
2. Right click on **Deeplink this page** and *Copy link address*.
3. Paste the copied URL into your communication mechanism (e.g. email, Moodle).
