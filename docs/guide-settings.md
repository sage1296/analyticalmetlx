There are three main charts, but other charts may appear after certain actions have been taken in the conversation.

### Render
 
This shows how long a render takes, which is to do with the performance of your device and browser.  
The initial render may take longer than average, and then MeTL should be reasonably consistent.  

### Server Response

This shows how long the server takes to respond, which is related to network and server load.  

### Latency

This shows how long it takes for a message to reach the server, which is related to your network.
